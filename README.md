## Author: Stephanie Hill

## Lab Class 26

![current state of things](./assets/Resty-1.png)

- We currently have a react app that displays a header, footer and form center page.
- In this developmental phase, the go button only displays hard-coded data
- In future versions the form will be linked to standard API REST functionality and be able to retrieve data for the user
- Our major accomplishment in this phase of development was converting all of our class components to functional components.

Stay tuned for future updates!

## Lab 27

- We have added functionality!
- Users please input an API URL of your choosing into the text field
- Select any of the rest methods below
- Press GO! and see the results displayed (API functionality permitting)

## Lab 28

- We can now target the headers in our API data!
- We also have a text area to input JSON data for your PUT & POST requests!
- All responses are formatted in pretty pretty JSON too, for your viewing pleasure
